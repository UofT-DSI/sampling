The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.
Scenarios

You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `#1`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
This study aims to investigate the reasons behind the high turnover among employees in entry- and lower-level positions in recent months.
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
  - target population : All current and recently resigned employees in entry- and lower-level roles across departments.
  - sampling frame : Companyâ€™s HR database of current employees and  former employees who left within the past 4 months.
  - sampling units: Individual employees
  - sampling strategy : Stratified random sampling to ensure representation across departments and job types. 

```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1.   1. On a scale from 1 to 10, how satisfied are you with your job overall?
     
        (1 = Not at all satisfied, 10 = Extremely satisfied)

2. On a scale from 1 to 10, how fair do you think your workload is?
     
        (1 = Not fair at all, 10 = Completely fair)

3. How satisfied are you with your salary?

         A) Very satisfied
         B) Satisfied
         C) Neutral
         D) Dissatisfied
         E) Very dissatisfied

4. How supported did you feel by your direct supervisor or manager?
     
         A) Very supported
         B) Somewhat supported
         C) Neutral
         D) Not very supported
         E) Not supported at all

5. How likely are you to recommend this company to a close friend with similar career goals?

         A)Highly recommend
         B)Recommend
         C) Neutral
         D) Do not recommend
         E)Strongly do not recommend

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```
1. Sample type : Stratified Sampling

2. Sample size : 24,000

3. Target population : volunteering and participating includes all persons 15 years of age and older living in the ten provinces of Canada.

4. Sampling frame : his survey uses a frame that combines landline and cellular telephone numbers from the Census and various administrative sources with Statistics Canada's dwelling frame. Records on the frame are groups of one or several telephone numbers associated with the same address (or single telephone number in the case a link between a telephone number and an address could not be established).

5. Survey mode(s) : Data are collected directly from survey respondents either through an electronic questionnaire or through CATI (computer assisted telephone interviewing).
6. Timeline : 2018-02-19 to 2018-03-30

7. Response rate: 41.9%.

8. Weights : Two weighting factors are available on the microdata file:

WGHT_PER: This is the basic weighting factor for analysis at the person level, i.e. to calculate estimates of the number of persons (non-institutionalized and aged 15 or over) having one or several given characteristics.

WGHT_EPI: This is the basic weighting factor for the analysis at the episode level i.e., to calculate estimates on the number of time an activity is done by the Canadian population. The WGHT_EPI has the same value as the person weight; it does, however, have a different interpretation. It indicates the number of time use episodes that a record on the Episode File represents.

In addition to the estimation weights, bootstrap weights have been created for the purpose of design-based variance estimation.

Estimates based on the survey data are also adjusted (by weighting) so that they are representative of the target population with regard to certain characteristics (each month has independent estimates for various age-sex groups by province). To the extent that the characteristics are correlated with those independent estimates, this adjustment can improve the precision of estimates.

9. Data processing:
-	Sampling
-	 Error detection
-	Imputation
-	Estimation
-	Quality evaluation


10. Cleaning, imputation, etc : Imputation was minimal and used only when essential for weighting. Missing sex values were imputed using related household data and interviewer notes. Other missing values were manually filled using related survey responses. No administrative data (e.g. tax linkage) was used in 2018.

11. Sources of error:
The survey used a sample, so results can vary from the whole population (sampling error). The response rate was 30.7%, so some people didnâ€™t answer (non-response bias), but weights were adjusted to reduce this. Some homes without phones or addresses werenâ€™t included (coverage error). Other errors come from how people answered or how data was processed. Using phone or online surveys might also affect answers (mode effect). 

12. Limitations, known biases, etc : The survey misses people without phones or addresses, has a low response rate which can cause bias, and answers may differ between phone and online surveys. Also, people might not always report accurately.

13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used:
