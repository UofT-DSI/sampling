# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
   Although the quality of the sample will be dependent on the total number of sample units, we cannot guarantee perfect representativeness. Althought the idea is to remove bias in the survey, and capture the feelings of those in entry level and lower level positions, it will not be a 100%. Unless we survey a large sample of that target population, we cannot expect representaion. A small sample size will not be enough to give accurate results.
    ```

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
    1. How long have you been with the company?
    2. What factors influenced your decision to join this company?
    3. Are you happy with your current role? Y/N
    4.What are some factors that would increase your satisfaction with the company? (select all that apply) 1. More Pay 2. Better Benefits 3. Career development oppurunites 4. Work/life Balance
`   5. What main factor is important to you in a job right now? (Select one) 1. More Pay 2. Better Benefits 3. Career development oppurunites 4. Work/life Balance
    6. What are some improvements you wish the company would make? (Open ended)
    7. Do you feel supported in the work place? Why or why not?
    8. If all factors stay the same, how likely will you change companies? 1 - 5, 1 is less likely, 5 is more likely.
    9. Anything else you would want to share to increase you satification within your role and company? 

    I added two more questions to the survey in the beginning to better understand why the employee joined this company intially and that would give me a better comparision to what they valued before starting at the company vs how they feel now that they are working here. I want to understand if the factors that influenced their decision to join the company are being considered and the company is able carry out those expectations.

    ```

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    No, since the purpose of this study is to determine the reasons for the high turnover rate and identifying the changes needed to improve employee satisfaction, we would need to streamline that data that needs to be collected. In an observational study, we would not be able to identify the reasons and hear directly from the effected employees. The informational collected from the obervational study would be inferred and can be untrue. 
    ```

## Why am I doing this assignment?

This assignment supports learning outcomes 1, 2, 3, and 4:
	1.	Develop ability to implement simple probability samples.
	2.	Understand more complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved.
	3.	Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies.
	4.	Develop intuition around survey quality.

## Rubric

-	All required components are present and complete **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Assessment of representativeness is justified based on class content **Complete / Incomplete**
-	Changes to original survey are justified based on class content and best practices for sampling **Complete / Incomplete**
