# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part B)

## Requirements
1. Comment on the quality of your sample. Do you expect it to be representative of your target population? Why or why not?

    ```
    The quality of the sample is expected to be relatively high because the stratified random sampling strategy is designed to ensure a balanced representation of both current and former employees across various departments. However, there are some limitations that could affect the representativeness of the sample. For instance, if certain departments have higher turnover rates or specific characteristics (such as a higher proportion of entry-level employees), the sample may be skewed toward those departments. Additionally, former employees may not be as willing or available to participate in the survey as current employees, potentially leading to a bias toward current employees who may have a more positive or neutral view of the company. Overall, while the sample is likely to capture a broad range of experiences, there is the potential for non-response bias that could limit its full representativeness.

2. Given the class content (error, survey quality, ethics) covered since Part A of the assignment, do you wish to make any changes to your original survey? If so, make a copy of your original survey and make any desired changes. Describe the changes and your reasoning. Provide a link here for submission.

    ```
   Based on class content regarding error, survey quality, and ethics, I would make a few adjustments to the original survey. One important change would be to include a question addressing the anonymity and confidentiality of the responses to ensure participants feel comfortable providing honest answers. Additionally, I would add a Likert scale for some questions to improve the precision of responses, especially for questions about satisfaction, recognition, and the likelihood of recommending the company. This would help reduce the subjectivity and provide more measurable data. Lastly, I would include a question asking respondents to indicate their tenure at the company, as it would allow me to analyze differences between long-term and short-term employees in terms of satisfaction and turnover reasons. The changes will improve the clarity, accuracy, and ethical standards of the survey.

3. Could the purpose of your survey have been fulfilled through an observational study? If yes, how? If no, why not?

    ```
    No, the purpose of the survey could not have been fully fulfilled through an observational study. While an observational study could provide insights into behaviors, such as attendance or interactions between employees and managers, it would not be able to directly capture employeesâ€™ personal reasons for leaving or their satisfaction levels. The subjective nature of job satisfaction and the desire for open-ended feedback requires a direct interaction with employees through a survey. Observational studies might provide indirect clues, but they would not be able to comprehensively assess the underlying causes of turnover as effectively as a well-designed survey. A survey allows employees to express their thoughts and experiences in their own words, which is crucial for understanding the nuanced reasons behind turnover.
