# Assignment: Questionnaire Design (Part A)

## Requirements
Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `2.`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of this survey is to identify key issues and values important to voters that will guide campaign adjustments for the partyâ€™s final month before the election. By understanding voter priorities, the party can tailor its messaging and strategy to align more closely with the electorateâ€™s preferences, helping to maintain its lead.
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target Population: Eligible Canadian voters who are likely to vote in the upcoming federal election.

Sampling Frame: A list of likely voters, drawn from recent polling data and voter registration lists.

Sampling Units: Individual voters, ideally representing diverse demographics (age, gender, region) across Canada.

Observational units: In this scenario, the observational units are the individual survey responses from Canadian voters. Each response represents the opinions, preferences, and priorities of a single voter, which collectively provide insights into what the electorate values and wants from the party and its leader.
```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. What is the most important issue for you in this election? (e.g., healthcare, economy, climate change, education, etc.)
2. On a scale of 1-10, how satisfied are you with the performance of our partyâ€™s leader?
3. What actions or promises would make you more likely to vote for our party?
4. How confident are you that our party will address your key concerns if elected? (Very confident, Somewhat confident, Neutral, Not very confident, Not at all confident)
5. What qualities do you value most in a political leader? (e.g., honesty, decisiveness, experience, empathy, etc.)
6. Which platforms or policies would you like to see our party focus on more?
7. How likely are you to switch your vote to a different party based on new campaign developments? (Very likely, Somewhat likely, Not very likely, Not likely at all)
8. Do you feel that our party understands and addresses the issues that matter to people like you? (Yes, No, Somewhat)
9. What would make you more engaged with our campaign (e.g., more local events, direct communication, social media updates)?
10. Any additional feedback on how we can better represent your needs and concerns?
```
