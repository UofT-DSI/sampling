1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.


# Your Changes

The number of your chosen topic: `#1`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of the survey would be to gather feedback from entry level/lower-level positions and create gather employee feedback. It would help in strategic decision making because we would be able to detemind the course of action needed to resolve the issues that are causing the high turn over rate. The purpose of the survey would not only idenitfy problems, but will also increase employee engagement and allow for higher transpaency. 
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Targe Population - All employees in entry level and lower level positions at the company.
Sampling Frame - The list of employees within the target population. So all employees in the database.
Sampling units - Each indiviual that is selected for the survey.
Observation units - Same as sampling units, the individuals selected for the survey.

Sampling strategy and Justification :
The strategy is to get responses from random employees from different departments within the same samepling frame and target population. This will provide a response and representation from multiple deparments and allow for good collection of responses.

Justification:

Once we get the responses, we will be able to determine if this is an overall issue and how the sampling units from the sampling frame truly feel. Since we are using the sample units from the sample frame, we will get accurate results.


```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. Are you happy with your current role? Y/N
