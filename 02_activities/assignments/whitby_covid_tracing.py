  Simulates the infection and tracing process for a series of events.
  
  This function creates a DataFrame representing individuals attending weddings and brunches,

  Parameters:
  - m: Dummy parameter for iteration purposes.
  
  Returns:
  - A tuple containing the proportion of infections and the proportion of traced cases
