# ASSIGNMENT: Sampling and Reproducibility in Python

Read the blog post [Contact tracing can give a biased sample of COVID-19 cases](https://andrewwhitby.com/2020/11/24/contact-tracing-biased/) by Andrew Whitby to understand the context and motivation behind the simulation model we will be examining.

Examine the code in `whitby_covid_tracing.py`. Identify all stages at which sampling is occurring in the model. Describe in words the sampling procedure, referencing the functions used, sample size, sampling frame, any underlying distributions involved, and how these relate to the procedure outlined in the blog post.

Run the Python script file called whitby_covid_tracing.py as is and compare the results to the graphs in the original blog post. Does this code appear to reproduce the graphs from the original blog post?

Modify the number of repetitions in the simulation to 1000 (from the original 50000). Run the script multiple times and observe the outputted graphs. Comment on the reproducibility of the results.

Alter the code so that it is reproducible. Describe the changes you made to the code and how they affected the reproducibility of the script file. The output does not need to match Whitby’s original blogpost/graphs, it just needs to produce the same output when run multiple times

## Sampling Stages in the Model based on function, sample size and proecedure involved:

 1. Infection Sampling
 • Function: simulate_event
 • Sample Size: 10% of event attendees.
 • Procedure : Randomly pick 10% of all attendees to be infected using np.random.choice.
 2. Primary Contact Tracing Sampling
 • Function: simulate_event
 • Sample Size: Depends on the number of individuals.
 • Procedure: For each infected individual, there’s a 20% chance they will be traced. This is determined by comparing random numbers with the trace success rate (TRACE_SUCCESS).
 3. Secondary Contact Tracing Sampling
 • Function: simulate_event
 • Sample Size: Depends on the number of events with at least two traced infections.
 • How It’s Done: If an event has two or more traced infections, all infected people at that event are marked as traced.

## All 3 types of sampling reflected in the blog: 
 1. Initial Infection (Infection Sampling): Randomly infect 10% of attendees to simulate the start of an outbreak.
 2. Primary Contact Tracing: Randomly trace 20% of the infected individuals to simulate initial tracing efforts.
 3. Secondary Contact Tracing: If two or more traces occur at an event, all infected individuals at that event are traced to simulate cluster tracing.

## Sampling parameters in the blog:
 1. ATTACK_RATE indicates people initially infected.
 2. TRACE_SUCCESS indicates success rate of tracing infected individuals.
 3. SECONDARY_TRACE_THRESHOLD indicates  minimum number of traces needed at an event to trigger further tracing.

## Visual Representation
The final plot shows how often infections and traces are attributed to weddings versus brunches across 1000 simulations. The blue bars represent the proportion of infections from weddings, and the red bars represent the proportion of traces linked to weddings.

The two codes you provided appear to be identical. Each code runs a simulation to model infections and contact tracing, then creates and saves histograms of the infection and tracing proportions. They should produce the same output when run with the same parameters. To make the code reproducible, we can set a random seed.
Additionally, we’ll reduce the number of repetitions in the simulation from 50,000 to 1,000 as requested. It ensures that every time we run the code, we get the same result. This is important part for reproducibility in simulations involving randomness.
