# ASSIGNMENT: Sampling and Reproducibility in Python

Read the blog post [Contact tracing can give a biased sample of COVID-19 cases](https://andrewwhitby.com/2020/11/24/contact-tracing-biased/) by Andrew Whitby to understand the context and motivation behind the simulation model we will be examining.

Examine the code in `whitby_covid_tracing.py`. Identify all stages at which sampling is occurring in the model. Describe in words the sampling procedure, referencing the functions used, sample size, sampling frame, any underlying distributions involved, and how these relate to the procedure outlined in the blog post.

Run the Python script file called whitby_covid_tracing.py as is and compare the results to the graphs in the original blog post. Does this code appear to reproduce the graphs from the original blog post?

Modify the number of repetitions in the simulation to 1000 (from the original 50000). Run the script multiple times and observe the outputted graphs. Comment on the reproducibility of the results.

Alter the code so that it is reproducible. Describe the changes you made to the code and how they affected the reproducibility of the script file. The output does not need to match Whitbyâ€™s original blogpost/graphs, it just needs to produce the same output when run multiple times

Sampling procedure:

The first part is about the probability of an infected person being traced.  We are planting the samples of being traced.  
We already know the probability is 20% from the TRACE_SUCCESS value.  

We are trying to simulate random sampling with the given probability by the following line:
    ppl.loc[ppl['infected'], 'traced'] = np.random.rand(sum(ppl['infected'])) < TRACE_SUCCESS

Target population is all 1000 people who attended wedding or brunch.  The sample frame is all infected people, which is 100.  
The sample size is 20, which is total infected (100) * TRACE_SUCCESS (0.2)

Then we calculate the probability of a trace from a wedding, with the added information that if a SECONDARY_TRACE_THRESHOLD number of 
people were traced from the same event, everyone from that event will be traced.
This was done with the following lines:
    event_trace_counts = ppl[ppl['traced'] == True]['event'].value_counts()
    events_traced = event_trace_counts[event_trace_counts >= SECONDARY_TRACE_THRESHOLD].index
    ppl.loc[ppl['event'].isin(events_traced) & ppl['infected'], 'traced'] = True

The sampling technique is snowball, because the first SECONDARY_TRACE_THRESHOLD number of samples will "recruit" the other samples.  

The graph produced by the python script does not look the same
as the one in the article.  The one produced by the python script
has the proportion traced to weddings most frequently at 0.15-0.2, versus the 0.5 shown in the graph in the article.

By moving the line 
np.random.seed(10)
to inside the simulate_event function, we reset the seed to the same number every time, so that the same numbers are 
generated, making the results reproduceable.
