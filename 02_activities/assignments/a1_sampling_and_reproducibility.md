# ASSIGNMENT: Sampling and Reproducibility in Python

Read the blog post [Contact tracing can give a biased sample of COVID-19 cases](https://andrewwhitby.com/2020/11/24/contact-tracing-biased/) by Andrew Whitby to understand the context and motivation behind the simulation model we will be examining.

Examine the code in `whitby_covid_tracing.py`. Identify all stages at which sampling is occurring in the model. Describe in words the sampling procedure, referencing the functions used, sample size, sampling frame, any underlying distributions involved, and how these relate to the procedure outlined in the blog post.

Run the Python script file called whitby_covid_tracing.py as is and compare the results to the graphs in the original blog post. Does this code appear to reproduce the graphs from the original blog post?

Modify the number of repetitions in the simulation to 100 (from the original 1000). Run the script multiple times and observe the outputted graphs. Comment on the reproducibility of the results.

Alter the code so that it is reproducible. Describe the changes you made to the code and how they affected the reproducibility of the script file. The output does not need to match Whitbyâ€™s original blogpost/graphs, it just needs to produce the same output when run multiple times

```
Sampling Stages:

1) Infecting Individuals: 
Method: Simple random sampling without replacement
Function includes np.random
Sample Frame: 1000
Sample Size:  100
Each person has an equal probability of being infected

2) Primary Contact Tracing:
Method: Simple random sampling 
Function includes np.random
Sample Frame: Infected individuals
Sample Size: 20 percent of the frame

3) Secondary Contract Tracing:
Method: Cluster sampling, events treated as clusters
Function groups the sample into two events
Sample Frame: All event attendees
Sample Size: Depends on the results of the primary tracing step
Conditional probability
```

The graphs produced by the code are not similar to the ones from the blog post. In the blog post, the proportion of cases that result from weddings are overestimated (double the true proportion), whereas the distribution of the graphs produced by the code are closer, both peaking around 0.20 within a similar range.The red distribution does not spread as widely and does not shift as far right as in the original blog post. 

Rerunning the script 5 times after changing the no of reps to 100, I see a huge variation in the graphs - distribution and peak-wise. The results are not reproducible at all. 

Added a seed to the code (np.random.seed(42)) which solved the issue of lack of reproducibility. Ran the script 5 times again and the results are consistent. As suggested in the question, they don't match the results in the blog post.
