|----------------|:--------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Sample Type	Probability sampling (Stratified random sampling)	Convenience sampling with stratified elements	Non-probability sampling (Purposive sampling)
Sample Size	~20,000 respondents	~5,000 respondents	Data collected from 16 individual bats
Target Population	Canadian population aged 15+ (excluding certain groups like residents of the territories)	Eligible Canadian voters (18+ years)	Glossophaga soricina (nectar-feeding bats)
Sampling Frame	Canadian Labour Force Survey (randomly selected households)	Online panel of participants who opted in to academic surveys	Selected bats from a specific geographic area in Panama
Survey Mode(s)	Telephone (CATI), face-to-face (CAPI)	Web-based (Online survey)	Field observations and direct diet sampling
Timeline	May to December 2018	During 2019 Canadian federal election period	2017-2018 (over several months)
Response Rate	Approximately 60%	Response rates not explicitly stated	Not applicable (wildlife study, not survey-based)
Weights	Applied to adjust for non-response and demographic balance	Applied to adjust for demographic imbalances	Not applicable
Data Processing	Data cleaning and standard processing (incomplete responses, adjustments based on sampling design)	Data processing and weighting based on demographics	Data processed in the lab for diet analysis
Cleaning, Imputation, etc.	Some missing data imputed, outliers removed	Some missing data imputed, but methods not specified	Data cleaned for accurate species identification and diet composition
Sources of Error	Non-sampling errors (non-response, measurement error, coverage error)	Non-sampling errors (self-selection bias, non-response)	Sampling bias due to small geographic sample, observational consistency issues
Limitations, Known Biases	Underrepresentation of certain demographic groups, non-response bias	Bias from convenience sample, potential underrepresentation of certain groups	Small sample size, limited to one species, findings not generalizable to all nectar-feeding bats
Citation	Statistics Canada. (2018). Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering and Participating, 2018 (Cycle 33)	Stephenson, L., Harell, A., Rubenson, D., & Loewen, P. (2019).
