# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

## The number of your chosen topic: `1`

## Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of this survey is to identify key factors contributing to high turnover rates among entry and lower level employees at a large tech company, specifically over the past few months. By gathering insights on job satisfaction, workplace culture, compensation, career growth opportunities, and management effectiveness, the company can implement changes to enhance employee retention and satisfaction.



## Target population: 
Entry and lower level employees within the company.

### Sampling frame: 
Active employees in HR records who hold entry or lower level positions (Based on the active employee directory) and have company email.

## Sampling units:
Individual employees selected from the active employee directory.

## Sampling Strategy: 
Stratified random sampling. Employees will be grouped into strata based on department and tenure to ensure a representative sample across key employee segments. Job role, department, tenure, and salary are assumed to be linked through employee email (key identifier), allowing for trend analysis without directly asking for these details in the survey.  While the survey is not fully anonymous due to the need for stratification, responses will remain confidential, and only aggregate data will be used in reporting.

### Sample Type: 

The sample type is probability sampling because in this case, every individual in the target population has a known and non-zero chance of being selected. 

Each individual or unit in the population (such as households or individuals in Canada) is randomly chosen, and the chance of selection can be determined.


### Sample Size: 

Field sample: 
Approximately 50,000 units were used.

Invitation letters: Around 40,000 were sent to selected households across Canada to complete the electronic questionnaire.

Expected completed questionnaires: 24,000 responses were anticipated.

This sample size aimed to provide robust estimates, ensuring accuracy at both the national and stratum levels.

### Target Population: 

Individuals aged 15 and over residing in private households across Canada's ten provinces. The survey excluded full-time residents (over six months) of institutions. 

Sampling Frame: The sampling frame consisted of groups of telephone numbers, from which households and subsequently individuals were selected. 

### Survey Mode(s): 
- Telephone interviews: Conducted with selected espondents.
- Self-completed electronic questionnaires: Respondents received invitation letters by mail to complete the survey online.

Note: The invitation mail itself doesn't count as a survey mode. It's only a method used to invite participants to the survey.

### Timeline: 
- Data collection for this reference period: 2018-09-04 to 2018-12-28
- Data release - January 26, 2021

### Response Rate:
The overall response rate is 41.9%.

### Weights: 
- Basic Weight (WGHT_PER): The basic weight accounts for differences in selection probabilities, ensuring that the survey estimates are generalizable to the target population.

- Bootstrap Weights: Used for variance estimation and assessing the uncertainty of estimates.

- Nonresponse Adjustment: Adjusts weights to account for nonresponse bias by using characteristics of nonresponding households.

- Volunteer and Rejecting Respondent Adjustment: A factor was applied to the weight for respondents who were not rejected and who were volunteers. This helped in correcting any biases arising from these different groups of respondents.

- Population Distribution Adjustment: Ensures survey estimates align with the actual population distribution, using data from the 2017 CIS.

These weights allow for more accurate, generalizable results that reflect the true characteristics of the population.

### Data Processing: 
The data processing for the 2018 General Social Survey (GSS) involved several techniques to ensure accurate and reliable results:

Imputation: Missing data was filled using donor records with similar characteristics to the respondent, ensuring completeness.

Weighting: Data was weighted to make the sample representative of the target population, adjusting for selection probabilities and non-response.

Bootstrap Weights: Additional weights were used for variance estimation, improving the precision of estimates.

Validation: The data was validated through time analysis, cross-tabulations, and comparisons with other data sources to ensure consistency and accuracy.

These methods helped ensure the quality and reliability of the survey results.

### Cleaning and Imputation: 
A donor record imputation method was primarily used, where similar respondents’ data filled gaps in incomplete records. A score function identified the closest match between donor and recipient records. 

For cases where donor imputation wasn’t feasible, mean imputation was applied. This process helped to complete missing personal and family income, volunteering, donation, and solicitation data. The aim was to ensure the dataset was complete and representative for analysis, improving its validity and reliability.

### Sources of Error: 
The main sources of error in the 2018 General Social Survey were coverage errors, non-response bias, and other non-sampling errors.

Coverage errors arose due to households without telephones or those not covered by the survey frame, potentially excluding certain parts of the target population. This could lead to slight bias, although efforts were made to minimize it by using linked sources like the Census and administrative data for a more inclusive coverage.

Non-response bias occurred at both the household and individual levels. To address this, adjustments were made to the survey weights, and additional data (such as income and household composition from administrative sources) were used to model and adjust for non-response.

Other non-sampling errors included response and processing errors. These were minimized through the use of a well-tested questionnaire, methodology, skilled interviewers, and strict quality control.

### Limitations and Known Biases: 
Coverage Bias: Exclusion of households without telephones, potentially missing some groups.

Non-Response Bias: Adjustments were made for non-responses, but some bias may remain.

Sampling Frame Limitations: WThe survey frame was built using various linked data sources, including the Census and administrative records. While these efforts improved coverage compared to past methodologies, over-coverage and under-coverage could still persist, affecting the representativeness of the survey population.

Self-Reporting Bias: Respondents may inaccurately report certain information.

Processing Errors: Potential errors in data handling and imputation could affect results.

These biases and limitations were minimized but couldn't be fully eliminated.
