# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `#2`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
```
The purpose of this survey will be to find out what matters most to voters as we head into the final stretch before the federal election. We will want to understand which issues are top of mind, how people feel about our party and leader, and what might sway undecided voters. The insights we gather from the survey would help shape our campaign strategy and messaging to make sure we connect with as many supporters as possible.
```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target Population: eligible Canadian voters (i.e., 18+ year olds) who are likely to vote in the upcoming federal election. Ideally this would cover supporters from all parties, undecided voters, and swing voters from various demographics (i.e., age, gender, education, income, etc.). Care would need to be taken to ensure the people responding to this survey match both the general make-up of Canada and the make-up of people who tend to go out and vote.

Sampling Frame: we could do social media ads targeting engaged citizens, online panels of likely voters, and party membership/contact lists. A challenge of this type of outreach is that online surveys may miss or underrepresent responses from older or lower-income voters, or those less active digitally.

Sampling units: each sampling unit is an individual voter selected from the sampling frame.

Sampling strategy: I think the best method may be to use stratified random sampling to ensure different groups are fairly represented. 
```

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```
Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)
1. Sample type - stratified sampling with probability sampling. Stratification was done at the provincial and CMA levels (27 strata), with information collected from one randomly selected household member aged 15+ to represent the whole 
2. Sample size - the 2018 microdata file contains 16,149 observations.
3. Target population - Individuals aged 15+ years living in private households across Canada's 10 provinces. People from the territories and full-time residents of insitutions were excluded.
4. Sampling frame - a combined frame integrating landline and cellphone numbers from the Census.
5. Survey mode(s) - In the 2018 survey, respondents were given the option to complete the survey online for the first time, in addition to the standard telephone interviews. 
6. Timeline - Sept 4 - Dec 8, 2018.
7. Response rate - 41.9%
8. Weights - a basic weighting factor was added for estimation, bootstrap weights were created for design-based variance estimation, and then additional weights were added to ensure that estimates were representative of the Canadian population.
9. Data processing - standard processing procedures, including editing and imputation to handle missing or inconsistent responses.
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc - see above + imputation was carried out in 9 steps.
11. Sources of error - coverage and non-response errors.
12. Limitations, known biases, etc - the introduction of an online survey response option in 2018 marked a significant methodological change, along with some definition and wording changes. This means that 2018 data is no longer truly comparable to previous iterations.
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used - StatsCan provided additional documentation through the following sources:
- 2018 General Social Survey (Cycle 33): Giving, Volunteering and Participating Public Use Microdata File Documentation and User Guide: https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/catalogue/45250011  
- General Social Survey Cycle 33 Dataset and Documentation: https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=4430
