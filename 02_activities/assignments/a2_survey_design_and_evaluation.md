# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used

## Part A - Survey Design: 

#  Here are the answers to the above questions:

#  SCENARIO 3: University of Toronto - Music Taste and Age

# Purpose of Survey:
```
This survey investigates the relationship between age and music taste, examining perceptions of popular music across age groups and how preferences change over a lifetime. Findings will contribute to sociological understanding of cultural consumption and generational identity, intended for academic publication.
```

# Target Population, Sampling Frame, Units, and Strategy:
```
Target Population: Adults aged 18-80 in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) who listen to 
music at least weekly.

Sampling Frame: 
(1) University of Toronto community database (students, staff, faculty - ~90,000 individuals), and 
(2) Community recruitment through libraries, senior centers, and community boards for age diversity beyond university.

Sampling Units : Individual adults aged 18-80 in the GTA.

Sampling Strategy: Stratified random sampling with age as primary stratification variable. 
Six age strata: 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-55, 56-65, 66-80. 
Disproportionate allocation oversampling older groups (typically underrepresented). 
Target: 600 total (100 per stratum). 

survey method :
We will run the survey mainly online, but we'll also offer a paper version to make it easier for older people to take part. Because we might get more responses from some age groups than others, we will use statistics to adjust the final results. This will make sure our findings accurately reflect the true age mix of the Greater Toronto Area

Justification:
 We separated people into different age groups because age is the main thing we're studying. We made sure to include enough older people so we could make fair and reliable comparisons between all the age groups. We used different ways to find participants to make sure our survey included all kinds of people. Finally, we used statistical weights to make sure our final results accurately represent the entire population.

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:
```

1. SAMPLE TYPE:
   • Stratified multi-stage probability sample
   • Two-stage: 
          (1) Geographic stratification by province (27 strata), 
          (2) Random digit dialing (RDD) using (landline + cellular)
   • One person aged 15+ per household selected randomly 
   • Probability sampling - all eligible persons have known, non-zero selection  probability

2. SAMPLE SIZE:
   • Target: 30,000 households
   • Final responding: 19,707 respondents aged 15+
   • Represents ~0.07% of Canadian population aged 15+
   • National margin of error: ±0.7% at 95% confidence

3. TARGET POPULATION:
   • All persons aged 15+ in private households in 10 Canadian provinces
   • Estimated ~29.5 million persons (2018)
   
 4. SAMPLING FRAME:
   • Dual telephone frame:
     - Landline frame: List of residential landline numbers (~60% of sample)
     - Cellular frame: Cell phone numbers from wireless providers (~40%)
   • Address Register: Links phones to Census geography for stratification
   • Coverage limitation: Excludes non-telephone households (~2%)

5. SURVEY MODE(S):
   • Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing (CATI)
   • Bilingual (English/French)
   • Average interview: 7 minutes 
   • Up to 10 contact attempts, refusal conversion attempted

6. TIMELINE:  
   • Reference period: Calendar year 2017 
   • Data collection: January 2 - December 31, 2018 
   • Data processing/weighting: January - October 2019
   • Public release: November 30, 2019

7. RESPONSE RATE:
   • Overall: 42.7%
   • Calculation: 19,707 respondents / 46,155 in-scope households
   • Non-response breakdown:
     - Refusal: 41.0% of in-scope (majority)
     - No contact: 11.3%
     - Other: 5.0%
  
8 Weights: Final survey weights applied to account for sampling design and non-response; calibrated to population totals 

9.Data processing Includes editing, coding, and imputation for item non-response using donor imputation methods


10. SOURCES OF ERROR:
    
    A. SAMPLING ERROR:
    • Due to sampling rather than census
    • Quantified by Coefficient of Variation (CV):
      - CV <16.5%: Released without restriction
      - CV 16.5-33.3%: Released with "E" flag (use with caution)
      - CV >33.3%: Suppressed with "F" flag (too unreliable)
    • National estimates: Very low sampling error (CV ~1-2%)
    • Small subgroups: Higher sampling error (may be suppressed)
 
    
    BIAS: Underestimates Indigenous, Northern, institutionalized elderly, 
    lowest-income populations
    

11. LIMITATIONS & KNOWN BIASES:
    
    MAJOR LIMITATIONS:
    
    1. Low Response Rate (42.7%):
        Below standard threshold
       • High risk of non-response bias
       • Respondents systematically different (more engaged)
       • Treat estimates as potential UPPER BOUNDS


    2. Social Desirability & Recall Bias:
       • Volunteering/giving overreported (socially desirable)
       • Memory errors (12-24 month recall)
       • Estimated overestimation: 2-5 points on participation rates

    3. Declining Telephone Survey Viability:
       • Response rates falling (52.9% → 42.7% over 5 years)
       • Caller ID screening increasing
       • Future cycles may need mode change  
    
    KNOWN BIASES (Summary):
    
    OVERESTIMATED:
    • Volunteering rate (+2 to +5 points)
    • Volunteer hours (+10-20%)
    • Donation amounts (uncertain magnitude)
    • Education/income levels in sample
    • Civic engagement generally
