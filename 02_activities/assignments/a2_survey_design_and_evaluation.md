# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `1`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
To identify the primary drivers of turnover among entry- and lower-level employees and pinpoint actionable changes that would improve satisfaction and retention. Findings will inform HR policy (compensation, workload, management, growth paths) and prioritize interventions by department and location.


Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
- Target population: Adults aged 18+ residing in Canada, across diverse age cohorts (e.g., 18–24, 25–34, … 65+).
- Sampling frame: Online access panel(s) and community recruitment lists (university affiliates, community centers) with provincial quotas; optional snowball via controlled referral links.
- Sampling units: Individual adults (with option to recontact a subset for a follow-up wave in 12 months for within-person change).
- Observational units: Individual employees, both current staff and former employees (leavers), serve as the observational units. Each participant provides responses reflecting their personal experiences and perceptions of satisfaction, workload, and reasons for staying or leaving.
- Overall sampling strategy: Stratified random sampling by department × location × role level among current employees to ensure coverage of hotspots; census invite to all recent leavers (last 6 months). Aim for ≥20 completes per stratum (or proportional allocation with post-stratification weights if small strata). Mode: email survey; two reminders; anonymous with optional contact for follow-up interviews.

Your 5-10 question survey:
1. Overall, how satisfied are you with your job? (1 Very dissatisfied – 5 Very satisfied)
2. How likely are you to recommend this company as a place to work? (0–10)
3. Please rate each area (1 Very poor – 5 Excellent):
    -  Base pay
    - Benefits
    - Workload/manageable hours
    - Manager support
    - Career growth opportunities
    - Recognition/feedback
    - Team culture/belonging
4. In the past 3 months, how often have you considered leaving? (Never / Once or twice / Monthly / Weekly / Daily)
5. What are the top two reasons you have considered leaving (or left)? (Select up to 2)
    - Pay/benefits
    - Workload/burnout
    - Manager relationship
    - Limited growth/promotion
    - Role fit/misalignment
    - Commute/hybrid policy
    - Team culture
    - Personal/family reasons
    - Other (open text)
6. Which change would most increase your likelihood to stay? (Single select + “Other” open text)
7. In the last 6 months, which of the following have you experienced? (Yes/No for each)
    - Discussed career path with manager
    - Took training relevant to advancement
    - Received recognition for good work
    - Adjusted workload/priorities collaboratively
8. Open comment: If you could change one thing about your job or the company, what would it be? (Open text)


The number of your chosen topic: `3`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
To measure how age relates to music taste and perceptions of “popular music” (e.g., enjoyment, quality, cultural relevance), comparing both across age groups and within individuals over time. Results will support a paper on age-related differences and longitudinal shifts in taste.

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
- Target population: Adults aged 18+ residing in Canada, across diverse age cohorts (e.g., 18–24, 25–34, … 65+).
- Sampling frame: Online access panel(s) and community recruitment lists (university affiliates, community centers) with provincial quotas; optional snowball via controlled referral links.
- Sampling units: Individual adults (with option to recontact a subset for a follow-up wave in 12 months for within-person change).
- Observational units: Each adult respondent (aged 18+) represents a single observational unit, providing information on their current music preferences, listening habits, and attitudes toward popular music. For longitudinal follow-up, the same individuals may serve as repeated observational units over time.
- Overall sampling strategy: Stratified quota sampling by age cohort × gender × province to approximate population distribution; oversample small cohorts to ensure analytic power. Random selection within panel strata; apply post-stratification weights. Mode: online survey; subset consents to follow-up (panel recontact) to enable longitudinal analysis.

Your 5-10 question survey:
1. On average, how many hours per week do you listen to music? (0 / 1–3 / 4–6 / 7–10 / 11+)
2. What are your primary sources for discovering music? (Select all that apply)
    - Streaming playlists/algorithms
    - Social media/short-form video
    - Radio
    - Friends/family
    - Live events
    - Traditional media (TV/print)
    - Other (open text)
3. Thinking about current popular music (top charts/viral tracks), please rate agreement (1 Strongly disagree – 5 Strongly agree):
    - I enjoy most popular music.
    - Popular music feels aimed at people my age.
    - The quality of popular music is high.
    - Lyrics/themes resonate with my life.
4. Which genres do you listen to at least weekly? (Select all that apply)
    - Pop
    - Rock
    - Hip-hop
    - Disco
    - Heavy Metal 
    - R&B
    - Alternative
    - Country
    - Folk
    - Electronic
    - Other (open text)
5. Compared to 5 years ago, my enjoyment of popular music is: (Much lower / Lower / About the same / Higher / Much higher)
6. Please name up to three current artists/songs you like most and three you like least. (Open text; optional)
7. For each statement, choose the most accurate reason (single best):
    - When I like popular music, it’s mainly because of: (Catchiness / Artist identity / Production quality / Peer influence / Other)
    - When I dislike popular music, it’s mainly because of: (Repetitiveness / Lyrics/themes / Production style / Overexposure / Other)
8. Age cohort: (18–24 / 25–34 / 35–44 / 45–54 / 55–64 / 65+)
9. Demographics (optional): gender; province/territory; education level.
10. Would you be willing to take a brief follow-up survey in ~12 months about how your music tastes have changed? (Yes/No; email for recontact optional)

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

- Sample type: The survey uses a probability sample (a stratified design with one respondent per selected household) as part of a cross-sectional sample survey.
- Sample size: The documentation states that “a field sample of approximately 50,000 units was used” and “about 40,000 invitation letters to the electronic questionnaire were sent … A completion of 24,000 questionnaires was expected.” However, the exact achieved sample size (i.e., number of respondents) is less clearly specified in the publicly available summary. The PUMF documentation lists 16,149 observations in the microdata file version: “955 variables, 16,149 observations”. 
- Target population: Persons aged 15 years and older living in private households in the ten provinces of Canada (i.e., excluding Yukon/NWT/Nunavut) and excluding full-time (six months or more) residents of institutions.
- Sampling frame: The frame is described as: groups of telephone numbers (landline or cell) associated with a given address (or a single telephone number if the number-address link couldn’t be established) plus the dwelling frame from Statistics Canada/Address Register. The frame therefore attempts to cover households with telephone numbers (including cell-only) and households generally via the address register.
- Survey mode(s): The 2018 cycle introduced an online (Internet) questionnaire option for the first time. In addition, computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI) was used. Proxy interviews were not allowed.
- Timeline: 
    - Reference period: the past 12 months preceding the interview date.
    - Data collection period: from September 4, 2018 to December 28, 2018. 
    - Data released: January 26, 2021
- Response rate: The publicly available summary and user-guide do not clearly publish a single overall response rate figure. The documentation mentions “about 24,000 questionnaires was expected” but does not clearly state achieved response rate in the summary. 
- Weights: Weights were derived from the design weights based on the probability of selection, then adjusted for non-response and post-stratified (calibrated) to align with known population totals from Statistics Canada’s demographic estimates (by province, age, and gender). Users of the Public Use Microdata File (PUMF) must apply these weights when producing population-level estimates to avoid biased results.
- Data processing: The survey used built-in edits and flow checks during data collection. The CATI system automatically enforced valid response ranges and ensured proper skip patterns. Additional consistency edits were conducted at Statistics Canada’s head office to identify and correct logical inconsistencies (for example, mismatched birth date and age, or missing demographic fields). Data from different modes (online and CATI) were integrated and validated for comparability before final tabulation and weighting.
- Cleaning, imputation, etc: Imputation and linkage were primarily used for income-related variables. Personal and family income data were linked to administrative tax records for approximately 82% of respondents. For remaining cases with missing linkage or incomplete information, donor imputation was applied to fill gaps using records from similar respondents. Since income questions were not directly asked in 2018, this administrative linkage fully replaced self-reported values. Minor imputations and derived variable calculations (e.g., total giving, volunteering hours) were also conducted to ensure consistency and completeness.
- Sources of error: 
    - Sampling error: Because the survey used a probability sample rather than a census, all estimates are subject to sampling variability.
    - Coverage error: The sampling frame relied on telephone numbers linked to addresses and the dwelling frame. Some groups—such as individuals without stable housing, people in institutions, and residents in the three territories—were excluded, which may lead to undercoverage.
    - Non-response error: Differences between respondents and non-respondents (e.g., people less engaged in volunteering may be less likely to participate) can bias results.
    - Measurement error: Respondents may misreport their giving or volunteering activities due to recall bias or social desirability, particularly when estimating hours or amounts donated.
    - Processing error: Although edits and validation were applied, data entry and coding errors may still occur.
- Limitations, known biases, etc:
    - The introduction of an online mode for the first time in 2018 may have affected comparability with previous cycles.
    - The “rejective sampling” design, where all volunteers received the long questionnaire while non-volunteers were subsampled, can complicate weighting and introduce selection bias if not properly adjusted.
    - The target population excludes residents of Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and institutional populations, limiting national representativeness.
    - Administrative linkage for income variables improved accuracy but created possible differences compared with self-reported data from prior cycles.
    - Mode and questionnaire changes mean that direct comparisons with earlier GSS-GVP cycles are not recommended.
    - Potential non-response bias remains, especially among highly mobile or disadvantaged populations.
    - Undercoverage bias may persist for households without telephone access or those difficult to reach via online or phone modes.
