# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 


The number of your chosen topic: `#1`

Describe the purpose of your survey:
The purpose of this survey is to understand the primary factors contributing to high employee turnover, particularly within entry and lower-level positions. The survey is to identify areas where the company can improve employee satisfaction, workplace culture, and overall retention strategies.




Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:

Target Population: All current and recently departed employees who held entry  and lower-level positions within the company in the past 12 months.

Sampling Frame: A company provided list of all employees who have either left the company or are still employed in entry and lower-level roles within the past 12 months.

Sampling Units: Individual employees from the target population.

Observational Units: Individual survey responses provided by the selected employees.




Your 5-10 question survey:

1. How satisfied were you with your overall experience working at the company? (Scale: Very Dissatisfied - Very Satisfied)
2. What were the primary reasons you considered or chose to leave your position? (Open-ended with multiple-choice options: Compensation, Career Growth, Workload, Management, Work-Life Balance, Other)
3. How would you rate your opportunities for professional growth and development within the company? (Scale: Poor - Excellent)
4. How supported did you feel by your immediate supervisor/manager? (Scale: Not Supported at All - Very Supported)
5. Did you feel that your compensation was fair compared to your responsibilities and industry standards? (Yes/No)
6. How would you describe the work-life balance you experienced during your time with the company? (Open-ended with scale option: Poor - Excellent)
7. Were you provided with clear expectations and goals in your role? (Yes/No)
8. What improvements would you suggest to enhance employee satisfaction and retention in your department? (Open-ended)
9. Did you feel valued and recognized for your contributions? (Scale: Not at All - Very Much)
10. Would you consider working for this company again in the future? (Yes/No/Maybe)





## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

Sample Type:
The survey employed a probability sampling method to ensure that every individual within the target population had a known and non-zero chance of selection.

Sample Size:
Data was collected from 16,149 respondents aged 15 and over.

Target Population:
Individuals aged 15 years and older residing in private households across Canada, excluding residents of the Yukon, Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and full-time residents of institutions.

Sampling Frame:
The sampling frame was designed to represent the Canadian household population aged 15 and over, excluding certain remote regions and institutional residents.

Survey Mode(s):
For the first time, the 2018 GSS GVP offered respondents the option to complete the survey via the Internet, in addition to traditional methods such as telephone interviews.

Timeline:
The survey was conducted in 2018, with data collection occurring throughout that year.

Response Rate:
Specific response rate details are not provided in the available documentation.

Weights:
Survey weights were applied to ensure that the sample accurately represents the broader Canadian population. These weights adjust for factors such as unequal probabilities of selection and non-response.

Data Processing:
Collected data underwent rigorous processing, including validation and editing, to ensure accuracy and consistency.

Cleaning and Imputation:
While specific imputation methods are not detailed, standard procedures likely involved handling missing or inconsistent data to maintain data quality.

Sources of Error:
Potential sources of error include sampling error, non-sampling error (such as measurement errors or data processing mistakes), and non-response bias.

Limitations and Known Biases:
The introduction of an Internet response option in 2018 may have impacted data comparability with previous cycles. Additionally, certain populations, such as residents of remote areas and institutions, were excluded, which may limit the generalizability of the findings.

Link to Documentation and Additional Sources:
Comprehensive documentation and user guides are available on the Statistics Canada website.
