# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1. In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2. Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3. Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios

1. You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2. You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3. You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s)
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used

# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design:

The number of your chosen topic: `#1`

Describe the purpose of your survey:

```
Answer: To identify the key drivers of high turnover among entry- and lower-level employees at our company and uncover actionable changes‚Äîwhether in compensation, career development, management practices, or workplace culture‚Äîthat would improve employee satisfaction and retention.

```

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:

```
Answer:
1) Target population: All current and former entry-level and lower-level employees who have worked at the company within the past 12 months.
2) Sampling frame: The HR database listing every entry- and lower-level employee hired or separated in the last year, including contact information and department affiliation.
3) Sampling units: Individual employees (each person is one unit).
4) Observational units: Responses provided by each surveyed employee.
5) Sampling strategy: Stratified random sampling by department (e.g., engineering, customer support, operations). Within each department stratum, randomly select 50 current employees and 50 separated employees (if available) to ensure representation of those who stayed and those who left.

```
