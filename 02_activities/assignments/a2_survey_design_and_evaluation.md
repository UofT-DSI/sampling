# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey

2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.

3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: #1
Scenario 1 Chosen: You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.

Describe the purpose of your survey:
The purpose of this survey is to understand the key factors contributing to high turnover rates among entry- and lower-level employees. The insights gathered will inform HR strategies aimed at improving employee satisfaction, engagement, and retention.


Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
Target Population: All current and recently departed entry- and lower-level employees at the tech company.
Sampling Frame: A company-maintained HR database containing contact information and employment status of employees who have held entry- or lower-level positions within the past 12 months.
Sampling Units: Individual employees listed in the HR database.
Observational Units: The same individual employees, as their experiences and responses are the focus of measurement.
Sampling Strategy: Stratified random sampling, ensuring representation from both current and former employees, as well as across key departments (e.g., engineering, customer support, marketing).

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:
Survey Evaluated: Canadian General Social Survey (GSS) on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (Cycle 33)

Sample Type:
Stratified random sampling was used. The survey used strata based on province, age group, and urban/rural regions to ensure representative national coverage.

Sample Size:
Approximately 22,000 respondents were surveyed.

Target Population:
All non-institutionalized Canadian residents aged 15 years and older living in the 10 provinces.

Sampling Frame:
The sampling frame was derived from the Canadian Address Register, which includes postal addresses linked to dwellings and households across Canada.

Survey Mode(s):
Mixed-mode:
Computer-assisted telephone interviewing (CATI)
Computer-assisted web interviewing (CAWI)

Timeline:
Data collection occurred from September 2018 to December 2018.

Response Rate:
The overall response rate was approximately 42.5%, though it varied slightly by region and mode.

Weights:
The dataset includes design weights and bootstrap weights to account for unequal selection probabilities and nonresponse bias. These weights allow for accurate population-level estimates.

Data Processing:
Cleaning: Outliers and inconsistencies were flagged and either corrected or excluded.
Imputation: Missing values for key variables were imputed using nearest neighbor or donor methods where necessary.
Validation: Internal consistency checks were performed to ensure logical coherence between variables.
Sources of Error:
Sampling Error: Inherent in any survey sample.
Nonresponse Bias: Due to declining response rates, particularly among certain demographics.
Coverage Error: Certain populations (e.g., institutionalized individuals) were excluded.
Mode Effects: Differences in response quality and patterns between telephone and online participants.
Limitations and Known Biases:
Respondents may overreport prosocial behaviors like volunteering and donating due to social desirability bias.
The survey excludes territories and institutional populations, limiting generalizability.
Declining response rates may introduce bias even with weighting adjustments.
