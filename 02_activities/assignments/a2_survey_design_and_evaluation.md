# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey
2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.
3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.

##### Scenarios
1.	You work in the Human Resources Department at a large tech company. Over the past few months, the company has been experiencing a high turnover rate across many of its departments, specifically within the entry- and lower-level positions. The company wishes to understand why this turnover is happening, and what changes need to occur to improve employee satisfaction.
2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.
3.	You are a student researcher in the sociology department at the University of Toronto. You are working on a research project that concerns the relationship between music taste and age. This involves both comparisons between different people of different ages and comparisons of the same individual at different ages during their lifetime. You wish to understand to what extent age influences music taste, specifically as it relates to perceptions of popular music. Your results will be written into an academic paper that you hope to publish.

### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
2. Sample size
3. Target population
4. Sampling frame
5. Survey mode(s) 
6. Timeline
7. Response rate
8. Weights
9. Data processing
10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
11. Sources of error
12. Limitations, known biases, etc
13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used


# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `1`

Describe the purpose of your survey: 
```
The purpose of this survey is to understand the factors contributing to high turnover rates among entry- and lower-level employees at a large tech company. The findings will help the company identify areas for improvement to enhance employee satisfaction and retention.

```
Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:
```
Target population: Entry- and lower-level employees at the tech company.

Sampling frame: Currently employed entry- and lower-level employees listed in the employee records on the companyâ€™s HR database.

Sampling units: Individual employees.

Observational units: Individual survey responses.
```

Your 5-10 question survey:
```
1. On a scale of 1-10, how satisfied are you with your current role at the company?

2. What are the primary reasons you might consider leaving your position? (Select all that apply)
Compensation
Career growth opportunities
Work-life balance
Management/leadership
Workplace culture
Other (please specify)

3. How well do you feel your contributions are recognized and valued by the company? (5 point Likert scale from extremely well reognized to not at all recognized). If they select a negative response, pipe to an open-ended survey question asking how their contributions could be better recognized.

4. Are you satisfied with the professional development and training opportunities available? (5 point scale from extremely satisfied to not at all satisfied). If they select a negative response, pipe to an open-ended survey question asking what professional development and training opportunities they would like to see.

5. How would you describe your relationship with your direct manager? (5 point scale from excellent to poor). 

6. What changes would most improve your job satisfaction?


```

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

Identify and describe survey features:

```
Sample type: Stratified random sampling.

Sample size: 20,000 respondents.

Target population: The target population for the survey included all persons 15 years of age and older in Canada, excluding:
1. Residents of the Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut;
2. Full-time residents of institutions.

Sampling frame: 1. Lists of telephone numbers in use (both landline and cellular) available to Statistics Canada from various sources
(Telephone companies, Census of population, etc.);
2. The Address Register (AR): List of all dwellings within the ten provinces

Survey mode(s): Telephone interviews and online surveys.

Timeline: Interviews were conducted from September 4th to December 28th, 2018.

Response rate: 80.745% (16,149 respondents)

Weights: Weights were applied to adjust for non-response and to represent all persons in the target population, including those not covered by the
survey frame. 

Data processing: Data were captured, coded into categories, cleaned, edited, imputed, combined and derived variables were created. 

cleaning & imputation: Records with missing or incorrect information were, in a small number of cases, corrected deterministically or imputed
from other information on the questionnaire.

Sources of error: Sampling error, non-sampling errors, and non-response bias.

Limitations: Certain demographic groups and area being underrepresented due to non-response. 

Link to documentation: 
https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/45-25-0001/cat5/c33_2018.zip I downloaded the zipped folder and accessed the file called "2018_GSS33GVP_PUMFGuide.pdf"
