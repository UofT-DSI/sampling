# Assignment: Questionnaire Design and Sample Evaluation

## Requirements

The goal of this assignment is to practice developing and evaluating sampling materials.

### Part A - Survey Design:

Select one of the scenarios below and design a survey to meet the need(s) outlined in the prompt.

Scenario selected: #2 (Political polls)

1.	In two to three sentences, describe the purpose of your survey

2.	Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and overall sampling strategy.

3.	Write a 5-10 question survey to address your chosen scenario below.


##### Scenarios

2.	You work for a Canadian national political party during a federal election. 
Throughout the campaign period, your party has seen relatively high approval ratings, but an opposing party is also polling favorably and may still have a chance to win the election. 
You are one month away from the election and you want to understand what voters want from your party and its leader in order to maintain your lead and eventually win the election.


### Part B - Survey Evaluation:

For the **Canadian General Social Survey on Giving, Volunteering, and Participating, 2018 (cycle 33)**, conducted by Statistics Canada find any and all available documentation for the data gathered and identify and describe the survey features indicated below.

1. Sample type
The sample was drawn from the Census data per household, and then stratified by province and population group. In each of the strata, a systematic sampling method was used to ensure representativeness.

2. Sample size
The total sample size was 80,000 individuals. These were composed of 60,000 regular sample and 20,000 oversample (added to enhance the accuracy of estimates for specific subgroups)

3. Target population
The target population for the 2023 SGVP is all persons 15 years of age and older in Canada. 
This excluded: 
- Residents of the Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut
- Full-time residents of institutions
- Residents of First Nations reserves

4. Sampling frame
The sampling frame was based on the 2021 Census of Population, but supplemented with additional administrative data to improve coverage.

5. Survey mode(s) 
Data was collected using a mixed-modes approach:
1) telephone interviews
2) Self-completed electronic questionnaires

6. Timeline
The data collection period started on Sept 15, 2023, and completed on Mar 30, 2024.

7. Response rate
The overall response rate was 40.9% (42.2% for the regular sample and 37.1% for the oversample)

8. Weights
The survey estimates were adjusted by weighting to ensure representativeness of the target population. These weights helped account for:
- stratificiation
- non-response

9. Data processing
Data validation: data quality checks throughout the data collection period (e.x., "checking the respondent's reported age against the date of birth coming from the sample file").
Data editing: reviewing and fixing inconsitent or missing values.
Weighting: applying different weights to adjust for factors such as non-response.

10. Cleaning, imputation, etc
Imputation was used for the following variables:
1) personal income
2) family income
3) variables related to donations
4) formal volunteering variables
5) informal volunteering variables.

11. Sources of error
The report lists the following potential sources of error:
- sampling error: possibility of the sample not beinf a perfect representation of the population
- non-sampling error: due to non-response bias (individuals who did not respond to the survey or declined) and/or measurement error (issues with data collection or participants not understanding the questions)

12. Limitations, known biases, etc
Some indicated limitations and biases are:
- non-response bias (some groups may not have been accurately represented)
- mode (differences in survey resposne based on whether the interview was over the phone or by electronic questionnaire)

13. Link to documentation and any additional sources used

# Your Changes

## Part A - Survey Design: 

The number of your chosen topic: `#`
2

Describe the purpose of your survey:

The purpose of the survey will be to determine which of the key political points over the course of the election are most important to voters, specifically those who are undecided who may vote in either direction. 

Describe your target population, sampling frame, sampling units, and observational units:

The target population will be individuals residing in “battleground” provinces where there are large variations in voting patterns. There are 8 key regions identified based on the most recent federal election, and these will be used as the basis for sampling in this survey (https://www.ctvnews.ca/federal-election-2025/article/high-stakes-battlegrounds-eight-ridings-that-could-shape-the-2025-federal-election/). 

A simple random sample will be used in each riding, with a target of approximately 150 completed responses per riding to allow for the identification of general patterns and differences. Respondents will be contacted using publicly available voter information or local directories. The questionnaire will be administered in a mixed-mode method of telephone and electronic survey. 

If respondents meet any of the following criteria, their responses will not be included and another respondent will not be selected: decline to participate, are not eligible to vote, or have decided not to vote in this election. 

As the populations in each of these ridings are very large, taking a sample of approximately 150 completed surveys per riding gives us enough data to identify some key trends. This smaller sample size is appropriate for a short political opinion survey where the goal is to capture key themes instead of details and/or precise responses.

Your 5-10 question survey:

For questions 1 - 5, please indicate how strongly you feel about the importance of the following issues in the current election. 
1 – Not important at all
2 – Slightly unimportant
3 – Somewhat unimportant
4 – Somewhat important
5 – Mostly important
6 – Very important

Question 1:
Cost of living (e.g., everyday goods such as groceries, retail goods, services such as internet/phone. Do not include housing)

Question 2:
Affordability of housing (rent and ownership)

Question 3:
Immigration policy and border regulations

Question 4:
Economic trade policy (e.g., international trade agreements, tariffs)

Question 5:
Environmental policy (climate change and sustainability policies)

Question 6:
How confident are you that the current party leader can handle national issues effectively?
1 – Not confident at all
2 – Slightly unconfident
3 – Slightly confident
4 – Very confident

Question 7 – 
Are you planning to vote in the upcoming federal election?
- Yes
- No
- Unsure

Question 8
If the federal election were held today, how likely are you to vote for our party?
- Very unlikely
- Unlikely
- Neutral / undecided
- Likely
- Very likely

Question 9
Of the issues listed above, which one is the most important to you? (Select one)
1) Cost of living 
2) Affordability of housing 
3) Immigration policy and border regulations
4) Economic trade policy
5) Environmental policy 

## Part B - Survey Evaluation:

2. Sampling frame
Publicly available votor records and/or local directories

3. Sampling units

4. Sample method
Simple random sample, stratified by political riding

5. Sample size
Approximately 150 completed responses per riding (~1200 total responses)

6. Survey mode

7. Non-response
The following individuals will be excluded: those who decline to participate, ineligble to vote, have decided not to vote

8. Limitations
Some individuals may decline to participate/respond, one method may be more represented than the other(telephone vs electronic survey) which could impact respondents willingness to answer truthfully.
