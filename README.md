## Description

This module introduces the essentials of sampling, probability, and
survey methodology. This includes simple probability samples, stratified
sampling, cluster sampling, dealing with non-response, estimating, and
survey quality. Participants will consider the theoretical foundations
of different sampling approaches, as well as practical applications, using Python, of
this knowledge towards contexts such as market research, political
polling, and the Canadian census.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the module, participants will be able to: 

* Implement simple probability samples. 
* Evaluate complicated sampling procedures and the tradeoffs involved. 
* Identify and understand sources of error or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies. 
* Assess survey quality.

## Assignments

* Assignment 1 - Due Date: June 22 2025
* Assignment 2 - Due Date: June 29 2025

## Delivery of the Learning Module

This module will include live learning sessions and optional,
asynchronous work periods. During live learning sessions, the Technical
Facilitator will introduce and explain key concepts and demonstrate core
skills. Learning is facilitated during this time. Before and after each
live learning session, the instructional team will be available for
questions related to the core concepts of the module. Optional work
periods are to be used to seek help from peers, the Learning Support
team, and to work through the homework and assignments in the learning
module, with access to live help. Content is not facilitated, but rather
this time should be driven by participants. We encourage participants to
come to these work periods with questions and problems to work through.
  Participants are encouraged to engage actively during the learning
module. They key to developing the core skills in each learning module
is through practice. The more participants engage in coding along with
the instructional team, and applying the skills in each module, the more
likely it is that these skills will solidify.

## Requirements

-   Participants are expected to have completed Shell, Git, and Python
    learning modules.
-   Participants are encouraged to ask questions, and collaborate with
    others to enhance their learning experience.
-   Participants must have a computer and an internet connection to
    participate in online activities.
-   Participants must not use generative AI such as ChatGPT to generate
    code in order to complete assignments. It should be used as a
    supportive tool to seek out answers to questions you may have.
-   Participants must have VSCode installed with the following
    extensions:
    -   [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
-   We expect Participants to have completed the steps in the
    [onboarding repo](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/blob/main/environment_setup/README.md).
-   We encourage participants to default to having their camera on at
    all times, and turning the camera off only as needed. This will
    greatly enhance the learning experience for all participants and
    provides real-time feedback for the instructional team.

### How to Get Help
#### 1. Gather information about your problem
- Copy and paste your error message
- Copy and paste the code that caused the error, and the last few commands leading up to the error
- Write down what you are trying to accomplish with your code. Include both the specific action, and the bigger picture and context
- (optional) Take a screenshot of your entire workspace

#### 2. Try searching the web for your error message
- Sometimes, the error has common solutions that can be easy to find!
   - This will be faster than waiting for an answer
- If none of the solutions apply, consider asking a Generative AI tool
   - Paste your code, the error message, and a description of your overall goals

#### 3. Try asking in your cohort's Slack help channel
- Since we're all working through the same material, there's a good chance one of your peers has encountered the same error, or has already solved it
- Try searching in the DSI Certificates Slack help channel for whether a similar query has been posted
- If the question has not yet been answered, post your question!
   - Describe your the overall goals, the context, and the specific details of what you were trying to accomplish
   - Make sure to **copy and paste** your code, your error message
   - Copying and pasting helps:
      1. Your peers and teaching team quickly try out your code
      1. Others to find your question in the future
