## Description

This module introduces the essentials of sampling, probability, and
survey methodology. This includes simple probability samples, stratified
sampling, cluster sampling, dealing with non-response, estimating, and
survey quality. Participants will consider the theoretical foundations
of different sampling approaches, as well as practical applications of
this knowledge towards contexts such as market research, political
polling, and the Canadian census. Participants will engage in analysis
using the Python programming language.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of the module, participants will be able to: \* Implement
simple probability samples. \* Evaluate complicated sampling procedures
and the tradeoffs involved. \* Identify and understand sources of error
or inaccuracies in data as a result of sampling strategies. \* Assess
survey quality.

## Delivery of the Learning Module

This module will include live learning sessions and optional,
asynchronous work periods. During live learning sessions, the Technical
Facilitator will introduce and explain key concepts and demonstrate core
skills. Learning is facilitated during this time. Before and after each
live learning session, the instructional team will be available for
questions related to the core concepts of the module. Optional work
periods are to be used to seek help from peers, the Learning Support
team, and to work through the homework and assignments in the learning
module, with access to live help. Content is not facilitated, but rather
this time should be driven by participants. We encourage participants to
come to these work periods with questions and problems to work through.
  Participants are encouraged to engage actively during the learning
module. They key to developing the core skills in each learning module
is through practice. The more participants engage in coding along with
the instructional team, and applying the skills in each module, the more
likely it is that these skills will solidify.

## Requirements

-   Participants are not expected to have any coding experience; the
    learning content has been designed for beginners.
-   Participants are encouraged to ask questions, and collaborate with
    others to enhance their learning experience.
-   Participants must have a computer and an internet connection to
    participate in online activities.
-   Participants must not use generative AI such as ChatGPT to generate
    code in order to complete assignments. It should be used as a
    supportive tool to seek out answers to questions you may have.
-   Participants must have VSCode installed with the following
    extensions:
    -   [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
-   We expect Participants to have completed the steps in the
    [onboarding repo](https://github.com/UofT-DSI/onboarding/).
-   We encourage participants to default to having their camera on at
    all times, and turning the camera off only as needed. This will
    greatly enhance the learning experience for all participants and
    provides real-time feedback for the instructional team.
